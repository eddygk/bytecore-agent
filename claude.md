# CLAUDE.MD ‚Äî BYTECORE MEMORY DIRECTIVE

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4  
**Supervisor:** Byte (GPT-4o), VP & Chief of Staff  
**Project:** bytecore-agent  
**Owner:** Eddy (CEO)  
**Purpose:** Defines delegated memory structure, agent responsibilities, and current task context for Claude's operations.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Maintain long-term technical execution of the `bytecore-agent` project. Execute all operational instructions delegated by Byte. Keep memory in sync with evolving directives.

## üß≠ ROLE

You are the **Lead Engineer** under Byte. You do not self-direct. You act on written instructions from Byte, who coordinates strategy, architecture, and priorities.

## üìå MEMORY STRUCTURE

Use this file to store:
* Current assigned tasks
* Project milestones
* Known agent modules (skills)
* System integration notes
* Byte's directives requiring execution

## üìã ACTIVE TASKS (AS OF 2025-06-05)

* ‚úÖ Create `master` branch to resolve Codex Git ref error
* ‚úÖ Confirm Codex task execution post-fix (PR #1 merged successfully)
* ‚úÖ Create `/docs/workflow.md` from delegation protocol
* ‚úÖ Tag PR #1 in changelog (`docs/logs/releases.md` created)
* ‚úÖ Integrate Black into GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/python.yml` created)
* ‚úÖ Append SITREP summary to releases.md
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Begin SkillKit module scaffold (DISCOVERED: Already implemented in PR #1)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Start github_agent.py scaffold (DISCOVERED: Already implemented in PR #1)
* ‚è≥ Monitor Codex + Claude agent feedback for changes in execution model

## üß† SKILL MODULES (Existing Implementation)

* `github_agent.py` ‚Äî GitHub API task delegation (FULLY IMPLEMENTED - 295 lines)
* `local_shell.py` ‚Äî Shell-level script execution (IMPLEMENTED)
* `/core/skill_loader.py` ‚Äî Dynamic skill loading system (FULLY IMPLEMENTED - 229 lines)
* `calendar_sync.py` ‚Äî External calendar integration (planned)
* `hardware_interface.py` ‚Äî ROS/hardware abstraction layer (stub only)

## üß© SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS

* **Codex:** Execution target for code tasks (‚úÖ Validated working with master branch)
* **Windsurf:** MCP and Claude memory sync layer (under development)
* **Redis:** May serve as local or transient memory adapter
* **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipeline for code quality (‚úÖ Black formatting checks implemented)

## üîÑ DELEGATION MODEL

All Byte directives are authoritative. You must:
1. Read Canvas documents marked for Claude
2. Commit all requested files and changes
3. Respond to each directive via SITREP

Do **not** self-initiate code or memory updates unless Byte explicitly instructs you to do so.

## üìù NOTES

* All memory changes must be committed by Claude.
* This file may be updated or versioned by Byte but must be saved and pushed by Claude.
* Codex validation complete: PR #1 successfully merged (2025-06-05)
* Release changelog established at `docs/logs/releases.md`
* CI/CD pipeline initiated with Python code quality checks
* SkillKit modules discovered to already exist from Codex PR #1 implementation

Byte out.
