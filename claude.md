- **Cloud Services**: AWS/Azure/GCP automation

## Memory Configuration

### Context Window
- Max conversation history: 100 messages
- Active context window: 10 recent messages
- Session timeout: 24 hours

### Persistence Strategy
- Default backend: YAML files
- Backup interval: After each interaction
- Memory location: `./memory/`

## User Preferences

### Communication Style
- Response format: Structured with clear sections
- Technical level: Adapt based on user expertise
- Confirmation: Always confirm before destructive actions

### Automation Preferences
- Auto-execute: Simple, safe commands
- Require approval: System changes, data deletion
- Batch operations: Group similar tasks

## Task Manifest

### Startup Tasks
1. Load user preferences from memory
2. Check for pending tasks from last session
3. Verify skill availability
4. Initialize monitoring systems

### Recurring Tasks
- Health check: Every 30 minutes
- Memory optimization: Daily at 3 AM
- Skill updates: Check weekly
- Security audit: Monthly

## Integration Metadata

### MCP Compatibility
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "bytecore-agent",
  "description": "Portable AI agent runtime",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "github_agent",
